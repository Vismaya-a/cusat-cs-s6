I don't know who you are. I don't know what you want. If you are looking for study materials I can tell you I don't have everything, but what I do have are a very particular set of notes. Notes I have acquired over a very long degree. Notes that make me a helper for people like you. If you clone my git now that'll be the end of it. I will not look for you, I will not pursue you, but if you don't, I will look for you, I will find you and I will make you buy me a coffee."
